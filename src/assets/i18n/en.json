I am highly communicative. Most of my life I worked with people by supporting marketing events and fair exhibitions. Finishing Business Communication, IT and Econometrics studies made me a mix of different worlds. If you are looking for a person, who in a long run, can be a bridge between departments or who can fit in diverse roles I might be the one for the job.\n\n\tIf you would like to contact me or leave some feedback you can use the contact form.\nI will highly appreciate that.\n\nI wish you a marvelous day :)\n\nBest regards\n",
